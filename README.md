# Financial Markets Analytics

Here is the work done together with my colleague **Niccol√≤ Puccinelli**. In particular, we built different market portfolios based on various parameters deriving from the regression in the **Market Model** equation and from the application of the **Capital Asset Pricing Model**. The Canadian S&P-TSX60 index was chosen as the basis for the construction. The language used is **Python**.

Final grade: **29**.
